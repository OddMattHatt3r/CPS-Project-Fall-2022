# HouseHunter

## Overview

HouseHunter is a Java application developed during my first semester of college for my Computer Science Principles class. It takes user input regarding their specific preferences for a new home and provides direct links to three popular house hunting websites, pre-filtered to match the user's criteria. This project aims to simplify the house hunting process by consolidating search efforts into one convenient tool.

## Features

- **User Input**: Collects user preferences including location, budget, number of bedrooms, and other essential criteria.
- **Automated Search**: Generates URLs for three major house hunting websites (e.g., Homes, Realtor, Trulia) based on user input.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the initial stage of house hunting by providing targeted search results quickly.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for the application.
- **HTTP**: Utilized to construct and manage URLs for web searches.

4. **Input Preferences**: Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter your desired location, budget, number of bedrooms, and any other specific criteria.

5. **Get Results**: Receive direct links to house listings that match your preferences on Homes, Realtor, and Trulia.
